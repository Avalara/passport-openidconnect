# Passport-OpenID Connect

NOTE there are some weird things with this repo. Please read carefully.

Master is way ahead of develop. Develop was cut from the 0.0.1 tag.
The 1.0.0 tag is way behind the 0.0.2 tags. The 1.0.0 tag represents the HEAD
of develop at the time I cut develop from the 0.0.1 tag.

Merging develop into master, therefore, will not have the effect you desire.

[Passport](https://github.com/jaredhanson/passport) strategy for authenticating
with [OpenID Connect](http://openid.net/connect/).

This module lets you authenticate using OpenID Connect in your Node.js
applications.  By plugging into Passport, OpenID Connect authentication can be
easily and unobtrusively integrated into any application or framework that
supports [Connect](http://www.senchalabs.org/connect/)-style middleware,
including [Express](http://expressjs.com/).
